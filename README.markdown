GitHub-Backup
=============

Idea/original implementation by Chris Lockfort (clockfort@csh.rit.edu) (Github username: Clockfort)

Python version by Anthony Gargiulo (anthony@agargiulo.com) (Github username: agargiulo)

Description
----

GitHub-Backup makes a local backup copy of all of a github user's  (or github organization's) repositories. 

Usage
-----
    ./github-backup.py USERNAME BACKUPDIR [-c|--cron] [-h|--help]

Then, put it in a cron job somewhere and forget about it for eternity.

Why This Software Exists
-------------------------
This software is useful in many cases:

  - GitHub suddenly explodes.

  - GitHub goes out of business.

  - Your corporation's backup policies are more stringent than GitHub's.

  - You have spotty/no internet access - perhaps you'd like to have all of your repositories available to code on while you ride the train?

  - You are paranoid tinfoil-hat wearer who needs to back up everything in triplicate on a variety of outdated tape media.
